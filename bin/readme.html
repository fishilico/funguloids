		<h2>About "Those Funny Funguloids!"</h2>
		<p class="blurb">Never before has collecting mushrooms been this mildly entertaining.
		At least not in outer space. It's more of a lifestyle than a game, really. Now with graphics and sound, too!</p>
		<p>Seriously though, we like to think the game as a space-flying-mushroom-picking-simulator. Well no,
		"Those Funny Funguloids!" is actually a nice little piece of entertainment. You collect mushrooms, bring
		them back to your home base and profit! That's the basic idea in a nutshell.
		It has smooth, appealing 3d graphics and nice atmospheric sound effects. Go ahead and try it out - it has sounds too!</p>
		<p>"Those Funny Funguloids!" is free, open source software. See <a href="#license">License</a>.
		<p>PS. Did we mention the graphics..?</p>

		<h2>Getting started &amp; How to play</h2>
		<p>On the first run, you'll see a Ogre configuration dialog. It looks something like this.</p>
		<center><img src="docs/config.png" alt="Ogre configuration dialog" title="Ogre configuration dialog" /></center>
		<p>Select either <b>Direct3D9</b> (recommended<a href="#opengl">*</a>) or <b>OpenGL</b> rendersystem from the list.
		Then adjust the individual settings if you want to. You're most likely interested in <i>Video Mode</i> and <i>Full Screen</i>
		options. The default is 800x600 in fullscreen, which is fine, but if your PC has the horsepower, feel free to crank up the
		resolution - it'll look nicer! :)</p>
		<p>After the weird looking title screen you should find yourself in the main menu. It's quite self-explanatory, so I'm just going to cover the <i>Game Options</i> - menu
		briefly. The defaults are the highest quality settings, feel free to tone them down if you notice choppiness.</p>
		<center><img src="docs/options.jpg" alt="Game Options - menu" title="Game Options - menu" /></center>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="version1">"Bloom Effect"</span> controls the subtle brightening bloom (glow) effect that's applied over the picture.
			The game may appear overly dark without bloom, as it's designed with it on.</li>
			<li><span class="version1">"Shadows"</span> controls the shadows cast by player and other light sources. Disabling them increases the speed dramatically on slower PCs.</li>
			<li><span class="version1">"Dynamic Lights"</span> controls the dynamic lighting effects from (for example) picking the mushrooms.</li>
			<li><span class="version1">"Dynamic Light Shadows"</span> controls whether the dynamic ligts cast shadows or not. If you're running slow, this is
			a good first choice to disable as it doesn't decrease the visual quality too much.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The volume settings should be self-explanatory. Now, you may be wondering, why there's "Music volume" when there's no music? Read on.</p>
		<p>Funguloids supports playing music (mp3, ogg, mod/xm/it/s3m + more!) from your music collection on the background when you're playing.
		You can copy your music files to the <span class="file">music</span> folder of the game, or open the <span class="file">music/playlist.lua</span> script (in Notepad, for example)
		and edit it to play your files from different locations. Pressing <span class="version1">F1</span> key in the game skips to the next track in the playlist. I recommend some
		nice and calm piano music, works really well! :) As of now, there is no music included with the game. Maybe in later versions, or in a
		separate "music pack", but no promises.. If you think you have what it takes, feel free to <a href="#credits">contact us</a> on the subject.</p>

		<p>When you finally get to the actual playing -part, you might be interested to know that this game uses only three buttons (either from the keyboard or the mouse) for its controls.
		<span class="version1">LEFT</span> and <span class="version1">RIGHT arrow keys</span> (or mouse buttons)
		turn the player around. To launch from the base, press either <span class="version1">SPACE</span>, <span class="version1">CONTROL</span>, <span class="version1">SHIFT</span> or <span class="version1">RETURN</span> (or click the middle mouse button).
		You can take screenshots with the <span class="version1">PRINTSCRN</span> key, it saves .PNGs to the game folder.
		Your objective is to collect colored mushrooms and bring them back to your base. When you get back to the base, the mushrooms of the base color
		will be unloaded (this increases your score - the more mushrooms you bring the more you profit!) and the level changes. Avoid the asteroids - no
		extra lifes in this game. There are other things floating around the space as well, but you'll find out about them yourself..</p>
		<p>And that's it. Enjoy the game!</p>

		<a name="opengl"></a>
		<p><span class="note"><span class="version1">*)</span> In the first version the OpenGL port was inferior, looked uglier (the bloom shader was not too great, my fault).
		Now the situation has improved greatly, it looks virtually the same as in D3D. So use whatever you want, or what works better for you. :) In my case, the
		OpenGL is still much slower (especially with shadows on), so I continue with D3D. I still recommend D3D for most Windows users, as it tends to
		be better supported. Your mileage may vary, of course.</span></p>

		<h2>System requirements</h2>
		<p>The game requires at least a moderate amount of power to run nicely. What matters the most
		is your graphics card. For the best visuals you need a card with <i>pixel &amp; vertex shader support</i> (<b>SM2.0</b> or greater preferred).
		It does run even on older cards, like on the crappy Geforce 2 MX in my old computer (I was surprised it actually worked, heh), but
		the performance is not very smooth and the graphics suffer quite a lot due to lack of shader support.</p>
		<p>On my own computer, which is AMD Athlon XP 2600+ with 768MB of RAM, and a ATI Radeon 9600 Pro, the game runs quite alright in 800x600 (with
		the best settings). Disabling the "Dynamic light shadows" helps to make it run well enough on my PC. The 9600 Pro is the bottleneck here.
		</p>
		<p>Here is some tips on how to make the game run better.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="version1">Turn off the shadows.</span> This increases the speed dramatically, although it doesn't look very nice without them..</li>
			<li><span class="version1">Reduce the number of shadows.</span> That means either turning off the <i>dynamic light shadows</i>, or disabling the <i>dynamic lights</i> totally.</li>
			<li><span class="version1">Turn off the bloom.</span> However, the game may appear somewhat dark without the <i>bloom effect</i> on, since the graphics were designed for the bloom.
				You can also adjust the bloom amount between 0.0 - 2.0 from <span class="file">gamesettings.cfg</span>. Reducing the bloom doesn't affect the speed, though.</li>
			<li><span class="version1">Reduce the display resolution.</span> Try running in 640x480 or 800x600 for the best performance.
				You can edit <span class="file">ogre.cfg</span> directly, or just delete it and select different resolution from the list at the game startup.</li>
			<li><span class="version1">Turn off the sounds.</span> Set the sound volume to zero in the <i>Game Options</i> to disable them, or edit <span class="file">gamesettings.cfg</span>.</li>
			<li><span class="version1">Use Direct3D instead of OpenGL, if possible.</span> Before you flame me, do read my comments on the <a href="#opengl">issue</a>.</li>
			<li><span class="version1">Keep your (display) drivers up to date.</span> Bad drivers equals bad performance. Stay up to date.</li>

		<h2>Building from the sources</h2>
		<p><span class="version1">If you're using a precompiled binary version, as most of you probably are, you can skip this. :)</span></p>
		<p>First of all, you need the latest source package. Download it from <a href="http://funguloids.sourceforge.net">http://funguloids.sourceforge.net</a>.
		As of now, the source package only contains project files (<span class="file">Funguloids.vcproj</span>) for <b>MSVC++ 2003</b> (7.1). However, you should be able to open that with
		<b>MSVC++ 2005</b> (8.0) and maybe with <b>Code::Blocks</b> too. Contributions such as project files for these and other compilers are welcome!</p>
		<p>To build Funguloids, you need to have <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">Ogre</a> (SDK will do) and <a href="http://www.fmod.org">FMOD Ex</a>
		installed. <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua 5.1</a> is included for <b>MSVC++ 2003</b> (might work with other compilers, too). Note that Funguloids was developed with Ogre <b>Dagon</b> (v1.2.5), and will most probably not compile on <b>Eihort</b> (v1.4.x) without
		code changes. I guess the input system needs the most work, since <b>Eihort</b> is using <b>OIS</b>. So get <b>Dagon</b>, unless you want
		to spend some time with the code. But if you do get it working on <b>Eihort</b>, I *really* appreciated if you'd mail me modified sources. :)
		I might do the port myself some day, though.</p>
		<p>Note that the project file assumes you have Ogre installed to a directory specified by the environment variable <span class="file">OGRE_HOME</span>.
		For FMOD, you have to add its directories to your compiler search path.</p>
		<p>When you have all the things set up correctly, the build should work alright. Well, then, what about other platforms? Read on.</p>
		<p>It should be possible, with some effort, get Funguloids built and running on Linux / MacOS X / etc.. I can only manage the Windows
		build myself, so I'm hoping that somebody using different platform could help me out with a working build.
		I think the possible problems lie in the file handling (configs, highscores, ...). All kinds of contributions are welcome! Btw, should you need to access the data in <span class="file">funguloids.mpk</span>,
		I can supply a simple tool for handling .MPK files, or you can roll your own using the sources (<span class="file">mpak.cpp/.h</span>).</p>
