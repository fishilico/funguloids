"Those Funny Funguloids!"
Copyright (c) 2006-2007, Mika Halttunen & Teemu Ruokolainen

This Linux version (v1.06) is based on my initial, preliminary attempt, and has
been since dremendously improved (i.e. made to use the standard autotools,
support for OpenAL added, etc..) by Piet (<funguloids@superpiet.de>). So big
cheers for him making Funguloids on Linux possible! =)

Please refer to INSTALL on how to build and install the game properly. You have
the option to use either OpenAL or the proprietary FMOD Ex for the audio output.
Ogre 1.4 or later, along with OIS and Lua 5.1 are needed as well.

See bin/readme.html for the rest of the documentation.


Thanks for the interest, have fun! :)
