"Those Funny Funguloids!"
Copyright (c) 2006-2007, Mika Halttunen & Teemu Ruokolainen

------------------
UPDATED: The initial release had the bloom accidently disabled,
it's been fixed in this release. Also, now the Linux build will use
ALSA by default. Edit gamesettings.cfg if you instead want to use the
default soundsystem picked by FMOD Ex (which may or may not be ALSA).
------------------

I have provided a simple makefile for building "Those Funny Funguloids!".
I realise it's not the best way to do things in Linux, and I'm hoping 
that someone more experienced with these things would provide a proper 
package using the autotools & what have you..

You need to have Ogre 1.4, OIS, Lua 5.1 and FMOD Ex properly installed. Open
the makefile and set the correct include directories for the libs, if the
defaults won't work. Then just run make and it should build. It'll look 
for the plugins from the OGRE lib directory, adjust plugins.cfg to 
reflect your settings.

See bin/readme.html for the rest of the documentation (it's 
heavily Windows oriented, though).

Thanks for the interest, have fun! :)
